1st part: Design
     I created an intended layout for the landing page in figma
2nd part: Coding
    a.
        I decided to try write both html code and external css code simultaneously for each element, as previously when i did one after the other for all the elements i tended to get lost in all semantic tags
    b. 
        firstly did the tags with fixed positioning, then article, animations and lastly media quaeries
